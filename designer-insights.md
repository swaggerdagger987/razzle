# Designer Insights

### Cycle 1 — 2026-03-23

**What I did**: Code-based design audit of all frontend files against DESIGN.md. Checked CSS, HTML, and JS for color tokens, border weights, radius tokens, shadow patterns, font usage, and dark mode compliance. Wrote 10 tickets.

**Quality score**: 7/10 — browse tool was non-functional so I couldn't do visual/screenshot verification. All findings are code-level, which is reliable for token violations but misses layout/spacing issues.

**What worked**: Parallel subagent strategy — 3 agents auditing CSS, HTML, and JS simultaneously saved time. Grep patterns for hex colors, 1px borders, and hardcoded radii were effective.

**What didn't**: Browse tool returned empty DOM for both live site and localhost. Couldn't take before/after screenshots.

**Pattern spotted**: The codebase has a consistent pattern of inline styles in JS files (lab.js, charts.js, lab-panels.js) that bypass CSS variables entirely. Canvas operations are the worst offenders since they can't use CSS vars directly — they need getComputedStyle() reads.

**Root cause found**: charts.js has no centralized color/token reading. Each function declares its own color maps independently. A single `getComputedStyle()` read at module init would fix DQ-007 and DQ-008 together.

**Suggestion for teammates**: Ship agent should fix DQ-001 first (1-line change, biggest blast radius — every dark mode page). DQ-002 + DQ-003 together (button shadows + hover lift) will make the biggest visual difference.

**What I'd do differently next time**: Get the local dev server with backend running so browse tool can capture full rendered pages. Layout/spacing issues are invisible in code-only audits.

### Cycle 2 — 2026-03-23

**What I did**: Sitewide pattern audit — broader grep sweeps across all 22+ HTML files and JS for box-shadow sizes, border-radius tokens, dark mode gaps, and cold color violations. Wrote 10 new tickets (DQ-011 through DQ-020). Total: 20 open tickets.

**Quality score**: 7/10 — browse tool still non-functional (CSP upgrade-insecure-requests blocks headless Chrome on localhost HTTP). All findings remain code-level. Confident in token violation accuracy but still missing layout/spacing visual issues.

**What worked**: Grep count queries across entire frontend/ directory were efficient for finding sitewide patterns. The 72-instance box-shadow finding (DQ-011) is the biggest single design drift issue — fixing it will make the chunky aesthetic noticeably more consistent. 4 parallel subagents covering home, Lab, standalone pages, and CSS+JS was comprehensive.

**What didn't**: Live site returned 502 (Render down). Local server started but headless browser rendered blank pages due to CSP `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive upgrading HTTP→HTTPS on localhost, which fails. No visual screenshots taken again.

**Pattern spotted**: Box-shadow undersizing is the #1 sitewide pattern. 72 instances across 22 files all use 2px or 3px at rest instead of the design spec's 4px. This is likely because earlier dev phases used smaller shadows and later phases copied the pattern. Root cause: no CSS class for the standard shadow — each element defines its own inline/embedded shadow value.

**Root cause found**: The 14px border-radius (DQ-012) appears in exactly 4 files that were likely built around the same time — archetypes, dashboard, lab-panels.css, tiers. Someone picked 14px as a "slightly larger than 12px" compromise and it propagated.

**Suggestion for teammates**:
- Ship agent: DQ-011 is the biggest bang-for-buck ticket. A regex replace of `box-shadow: 2px 2px 0` → `box-shadow: 4px 4px 0` across HTML files handles most of it, but review each instance — small badge elements (2px border) should keep 2px shadow.
- Ship agent: DQ-012 is a 4-line fix. DQ-013 is a 2-line fix. Do these together.
- Ship agent: DQ-015 + DQ-020 fix dark mode readability on tiers and dashboard pages.

**What I'd do differently next time**: File a ticket to temporarily disable CSP upgrade-insecure-requests in dev mode so the browse tool can render pages. Visual QA without screenshots is flying blind. Also consider adding a CSS utility class like `.shadow-chunky { box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 var(--ink); }` to prevent future shadow drift.
