# Memory — Reality Checker

Append-only log of recurring failure patterns, evidence gaps, false-PASS
near-misses, and verification techniques that caught real issues.

Format per entry:

```
YYYY-MM-DD | claim under review | evidence type (curl/screenshot/test) | layer/PARITY claim | verdict | issue class | keep | discard | revisit
```

Read this file before reviewing a claim. Recurring failure classes deserve
explicit checks in the verification routine.
